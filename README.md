The Odin Project: Javascript & jQuery

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lnav

This project was fun and simple. Refamiliarized myself with jQuery/javaScript. No major hiccups. Excited to learn more. I'd like to come back and add more functionality when I learn how. E.g.:
	Keeping the 'random' or 'classic' buttons highlighted after being selected could be nice. 
	Display the number of squares being used.
	Use some forms/dials to choose your options.
	Make buttons look fancy.
	Add smooth random color transition option.
	Add draw option where you must click and hold to draw.
